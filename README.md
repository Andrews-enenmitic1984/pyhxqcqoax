Oh man, just got out of “The Life List”, and wow, my head’s kinda spinning. The theater was this chaotic cacophony — people munching on popcorn like their lives depended on it. Felt like I was sitting in a drum. God, and my back’s screaming from those seats, like I just wrestled a grizzly and lost.

So the movie — first off, it was like someone spilled a box of crayons on the screen and, in some mad way, it all made sense. There was this one scene, I swear, where the main character, Jane, she’s running through this field of sunflowers, and all I could think was, “this is the part where unicorns should show up.” No unicorns though. Dreams dashed.

> Then there’s this part when she’s staring at this old list she wrote when she was a kid, and dude, it’s like looking into a time capsule of her heart. Made me wonder — do I even remember my wishes from when I was ten? Lost in the sands of my memory somewhere between “become a wizard” and “own a dinosaur”.

I should remember to tell Mark to download the movie. I mean, even just to see what all the damn fuss is about. It’s kinda like when you’re trying to reassemble a jigsaw with pieces from different puzzles. Rainy day, sunshine smile, total mind puddle. I’m sure Tracy would want to watch the movie, if only to tear apart that ending.

And listen, there was popcorn EVERYWHERE. Crumbs spread across the floor like domestic confetti, marking the battlefield of diverse cinematic opinions. And the guy next to me kept gasping dramatically at the plot twists like he’d never seen a movie before.

> At some point, Jane is riding a bike downhill, and all I could think was how before you download an app update, your phone warns you about the risks. Felt like a metaphor for her life. Or maybe I’m just stretching. Can’t escape that damn theater smell. It lingers.

Oh right, you remember to always wear comfortable pants to movies longer than two hours. Seriously, critical. I was fidgeting like a hyperactive squirrel. I should have worn my sneakers. My toes cramped, total betrayal.

What was I saying? It was like… oh, doesn’t matter. Better grab some dinner now, all those sunflower scenes made me weirdly hungry. Damn, they knew how to play with colors. Must tell Susan about that insane lighting—like a disco ball combo-ed with a Monet painting.

Here's what makes sense to the splattered brain right now:

```
function enjoyMovie(lifeList) {
    for(let dream of lifeList){
        if(!dream.complete) {
            dream.wonder();
        }
    }
    return 'Who knows, right?';
}
```
